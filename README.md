# Energy Australia Coding Test
Angular version 8.2.1.
Node Version: 10.6.0+

## Development server
Steps to run dev server.

Run `npm run mockserver` for a backend server.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Unit Testing

Run `npm run test` for executing test cases.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Api Endpoints
I didnt realise that there was a live api. i created a mock server instead. 
realized after submitting the test. 

Also when trying to access the real api, getting some cors issue now(Cors is been taken care in mock backend server which is part of this app).

Nevertheless, if the mock server and angular is running, it would produce the desirable result when the above instructions are followed for running the app.
